# Breast-Cancer-Classification-using-Deep-Learning-Models
Using ultrasound pictures, histopathology pictures, and the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset, as well as tabular data from each, our research offers a thorough examination of breast cancer classification algorithms. Our goal was to improve cancer patient outcomes and diagnostic accuracy by careful data preparation, model selection, training, and assessment. Our results show that deep learning architectures, and DenseNet121 in particular, are effective in classifying images from histopathology and ultrasound, two very complicated types of images. In contrast, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest, two classic machine learning classifiers, proved their mettle with tabular data analysis, proving they excel with structured datasets
